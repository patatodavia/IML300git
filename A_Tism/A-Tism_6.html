      Having roomates, especially as an autistic person, can be very challenging. I struggle with understanding personal boundaries and social cues, which can lead to misunderstandings and discomfort. The constant presence of another person in my living space can make it difficult to find moments of solitude and calm, which are essential for my well-being. Additionally, sensory sensitivities can make shared living spaces overwhelming, especially when it comes to noise levels, smells of perfume, and differing routines. I have had very difficult experiences with miscommunication and conflicts with roomates in the past, which have contributed to my preference for living alone. Overall, while having roomates can offer social opportunities, the challenges often outweigh the benefits for me as an autistic individual.
