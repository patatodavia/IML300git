      <h2>About This Website</h2>
      <p>
        This is an interactive website that portrays my personal experience as an autistic person. 
        I specifically mention that this is my personal experience, as autism is a spectrum and can 
        be experienced very differently by different people. This is by no means a generalization 
        of autism, only a representation of my own experience.
      </p>
